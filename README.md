# Capstone-Project-1

This project is a resume that I created without using any CSS. I did this as a challenge to myself and to show that it is possible to create a professional-looking resume using only HTML.

I chose to do this project without CSS because I wanted to see how far I could push myself and to learn more about the capabilities of HTML alone. I also wanted to create a resume that was accessible to everyone, regardless of their browser or device.

I am aware that many potential employers may value CSS skills, but I want to assure viewers that I am still a capable and skilled web developer. I have a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am able to use these skills to create high-quality and accessible websites.

I encourage viewers to look beyond the lack of CSS in this project and to focus on the overall design and layout. I am confident that this resume is still professional and visually appealing, even without the use of CSS.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
